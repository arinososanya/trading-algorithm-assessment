/*
Overview: Adding and Cancelling
1. Get the best bid and ask and then calculate the spread.
I also want to log the number of bid and ask levels for a broader view of market depth.

2. I want to allow for up to 3 multiple active orders at different levels below the current market price
because if the price drops significantly, I might fill multiple orders and acquire a larger position at a good average price.



 /*
        Mine:
        Evaluate the current market state using SimpleAlgoState state method


        Get current active orders
      var activeOrders = state.getActiveChildOrders();

        // If I have active orders, cancel the old or oldest one. Oldest one = > 10 ticks
        if(!activeOrders.isEmpty()){

        }

        // If the no of active orders is below the maximum limit, (MAX_ORDERS), then my algo will consider adding a new buy order just above the best bid price


        // If we didn't cancel or create an order, do nothing
        return NoAction.NoAction;*/

        /* To make profit: I want to sell the asset for more than I bought it for. The smaller the spread,
        the quicker you might be able to make a profit, but potentially a smaller one.
        create a buy and sell threshold in your logic with your
        algo only buying when your price is at that threshold or below it
        and selling when it reaches your sell threshold or exceeds it.
        We could use the new trade method in SimpleAlgoState to analyse this.
